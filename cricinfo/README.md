This is a Vehicle Security System website that utilizes RFID hardware for seamless scanning. It provides users with both a web application and an Android application, granting them the convenience of digital access control. With just a single click, users can easily manage permissions for others.

The project follows a robust 3-tier architecture:

Frontend: Built using ReactJS
Backend: Powered by Firebase
Database: Utilizes Firebase Realtime Database

For user authentication and data storage, we rely on Google Firebase. User images are securely stored in Firebase Cloud Storage.

To ensure optimal performance and user experience, we've implemented:

    Lazy Loading: Components load on-demand, reducing initial page load times.
    Code Splitting: Resources are split into smaller chunks for efficient loading.
    Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for streamlined and responsive design.
    React Context API: Provides a consistent dark/light theme throughout the website.

Our system enables users to grant or revoke permissions within a user-defined timestamp, seamlessly updating the database in real-time.

This project was a collaborative effort by a dedicated team of four:

    Mansi Kumari Roy
